/**
 * Effect checking and inference works very similar to type checking and inference. For
 * each effect system, there are two phases added to the compilation: an EffectInferencer
 * and an EffectChecker. These pairs behave very similarly to the Namer-Typer phase during
 * ordianry type-checking.
 * 
 * The EffectInferencer is a transformer phase, but it does not actually change the trees
 * in any way (see `def transform`: it calls `super.transform` in the end). However, it still
 * needs to be a transformer, because the it needs a local typer instance which has the right
 * context in each DefDef or ValDef, which is provided by TypingTransformer. Therefore, the
 * EffectInferencer is implemented using a TypingTransformer (if a TypingTraverser existed,
 * that could e used).
 * 
 * What the effectInferencer does is assigning lazy types to some method and value symbols.
 * There are two situations in which the type of a symbol changes:
 * 
 *  1. Effect inference, the type of a method acquires an effect annotation. Example:
 *  
 *       def foo(): Int @infer = { do-stuff(); 1 }
 *
 *     The type of foo will be a lazy type that, when completed, computes the effect of the
 *     body using `computeEffect`, and then assigns the type `Int @someEffect` to the symbol
 *     of `foo`.
 *     
 *  2. Refinement type inference, the type of the returned value becomes a refinedment. This
 *     mostly happens with anonymous functions, for example:
 *     
 *       val f: (Int => Int) @refine = (x: Int) => x + 1
 *       val g: C @refine = new C { def foo() = 1 }
 *     
 *     The EffectInferencer assigns a lazy type that, when being completed, computes the type
 *     of the righthand side using `computeType`. In both examples, the type of the expression
 *     becomes more specific when taking side effects into account. Concretely they are:
 *     
 *       f: (Int => Int) { def apply(x: Int): Int @pure }  // i.e. a pure Function
 *       g: C { def foo(): Int @pure }                     // i.e. a `C`, but with a pure `foo`
 *
 *
 * The code that computes side-effects (`computeEffect`) and refined types (`computeType`) is
 * in the EffectChecker class, see there for more documentation.
 * 
 * 
 * === TYPING TRANSFORMERS ===
 * 
 * There are three typing transformers involved in the effect checking process
 * 
 *  - EffectInferencer is a TypingTransformer (see explanation above)
 *  - RefineTransformer (in the EffectChecker), see its documentation
 *  - Checker (in EffectChecker), see its documentation
 * 
 * The defining property of a TypingTransformer is that while traversing a tree, it always
 * provides a typer instance (`localTyper`) with the right context for the current subtree,
 * and the `currentOwner` symbol.
 * This is done using the `atOwner(sym)(body)` function, which the traverser invokes on every
 * tree that defines a symbol (ClassDef, DefDef etc).
 * 
 * One problem is that the RefineTransformer is being invoked not on the root of the tree,
 * but basically on the `rhs` tree of a ValDef or DefDef. Therefore, we have to manually
 * initialize its context, which is `localTyper` and `currentOwner`.
 *
 * For that reason:
 *  - Many functions in the EffectChecker (`computeType`, `computeEffect`, `checkDefDef`, ...)
 *    take two arguments `typer` and `owner`, which they basically thread through. Each of
 *    these functions might eventually call `refine`, which creates a RefineTransformer with
 *    the correct context.
 *    
 *  - Since we use the above-mentioned functions in the EffectInferencer and in the Checker
 *    (the two Traversers that start at the root), we need to have the right context at hand.
 *    Therefore, these two are TypingTransformers.
 * 
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: When modifying these traversers, be careful to keep `currentOwner` and
 * `localTyper` correct, and to use the correct values when calling `refine`, `computeType`
 * or similar. Concretely: The `transform` method in the Transformer calls `atOwner` on
 * every tree that defines a symbol (ClassDef, DefDef, Function, etc), see method `transform`
 * in class `Transformer`.
 * So when you override `transform` and catch such a tree, remember that you have to call
 * `atOwner` yourself in order to get the correct typer!
 *   
 *   MyTypingTransformer <: TypingTransformer {
 *     override def transform(t: Tree) = t match {
 *       case DefDef =>
 *         // currentOwner, localTyper still refer to the outer next
 *         atOwner(t.symbol) {
 *           // here, you have the currentOwner, localTyper for that DefDef
 *         }
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 * When you call `computeType(rhs, owner, typer)` for instance, you have to pass it the
 * correct owner and typer, i.e. the ones *after* a call to `atOwner`.

  /**
   * The EffectInferencer has to be a dummy InfoTransformer. This is to invalidate
   * caches of symbol-attached types, because types can change. Example:
   *
   *   val f7: (Int => Int) @refine = (x: Int) => x    // (1)
   *   def v7(x: Int): Int @noEff = f7.apply(x)        // (2)
   *
   * The type of "val f7" (1) changes to a "RefinedType".
   *
   * When re-typechecking Select(this.f7, apply) of (2), the type of "this.f7"
   * is "SingleType(this, f7)".
   *
   * typedSelect calls "memberType" on this SingleType, which calls "underlying",
   * which has a cache.
   * The "underlying" of f7 is now different, it used to be "Int => Int", now it's
   * the "RefinedType(Int => Int, {def apply})".
   *
   * If there's no InfoTransform, the cache is not invalidated!
   *
   * Since InfoTransformers are only applied at the next phase, we need to make
   * the EffectInferencer an InfoTransform, not the EffectChecker (where we actually
   * look at the symbol's tyeps).
